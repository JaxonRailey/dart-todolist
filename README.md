# TodoList in Dart

Yet another todolist but this time written in Dart.

Launch ```dart pub get``` command to download the dependencies and then ```webdev serve``` command to view it on the browser in the address ```http://127.0.0.1:8080/```. 

To create a production version, run the ```webdev build``` command.
